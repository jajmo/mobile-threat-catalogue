        In order to fully address the inherent threats of mobile devices,
        a wider view of the mobile ecosystem is necessary. This repository
        contains the Mobile Threat Catalogue, which describes, identifies, and
        structures the threats posed to mobile information systems. The <a href="/mobile-threat-catalogue/background/">background</a> page
        provides context and a description of the origins of this repository.
    <br /><br />
      Readers of the catalogue may notice
      threats that are not tied to a documented source or lack countermeasures,
      and other threats may exist that are not identified here. This catalogue is
      intended as a living document. Though the initial comment period is now closed,
      feedback on mobile threats addressed in
      the catalogue as well as ideas for additional threats are still encouraged.
